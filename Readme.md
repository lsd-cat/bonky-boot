## Sha256
The `sha256` has been written from scratch directly in assembly. It uses as little RAM as possible and exploits the larger availability of registers compared to other architectures. It uses 32 bytes for the initial hash constants that get replaced with the computed ones at the end of the processing of every block, 256 bytes for the 64 `k` words that are immutable and 64 bytes for the `state`. While usual implemenetations allocate 64 words, one for each of the rounds, this one uses only 16 words, progressively replacing the older ones since they are no longer needed. Furthermore, the hashing context is just plain registers, thus no extra memory read or write operations happens.
